## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Customizations

### Scrolling

The original project has been changed to incorporate **scrolling** to sections.

### Nav Bar

The project now also dynamically populates the **nav bar** following any additional sections.

### Active Sections

Sections that are active also receive a specific class, by which they are styled with a dashed border.
